It's a project for beginners in Python who are learning flow control, function declaration, working with random library and so on.

It shows some experiments with turtle module, like drawing some alphabet letters, changing a turtle to a gif image and drawing a bunch of circles. It also uses the random library to change colors and circle positions randomly.
